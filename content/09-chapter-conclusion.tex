\ac{fastPLI} is a unique tool to provide user friendly methods which are capable of designing non colliding dense white matter nerve fiber bundles and simulating them inside a virtual \ac{3D-PLI} microscopy.

\paragraph{\nameref{chap:sof:modelling}}
The tissue modelling software is capable of producing non colliding dense white nerve fiber models.
This library is parallelized for the \ac{CPU}.
\par
% Outlook
The algorithm is written for the \ac{CPU}. However this type of algorithm is highly recomended the usage of a \ac{GPU}.
\cite{Karras2012} describes such an algorithm based on \ac{AABB} and a parallelized z-ordered tree instead of an octree.
Since the \-ordered tree can be build in parallel, the collision checking can begin almost immediately.
