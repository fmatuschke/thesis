% \paragraph{Nerve fiber modelling}
% % 
% The algorithm is written for the \ac{CPU}.
% However, the use of a \ac{GPU} is strongly recommended for this type of algorithm.
% In the literature there are already algorithms optimized for such a collision checking algorithm.
% One type of these algorithms that is particularly suitable here is based on the \ac{AABB} used here and a z-ordered tree instead of an octree.
% Not only is the collision checking computed in parallel, but the preparation of the data into a z-tree is also done in parallel on the \ac{GPU}.
% There is no longer a need to use the \ac{CPU} between steps or to copy data between the \ac{CPU} and \ac{GPU}.
% This drastically increases the speed of the collision check \cite{Karras2012}.

% \paragraph{Simulation}
% % 
% In the future, more complex models, probably up to three fiber populations, and different fiber radii need to be investigated.
% It is expected that larger fiber radii will have a stronger influence on the inclination measurements.
% How this can be properly analyzed is an open question at this time.
% Since these large fiber radii exist in brains, this is an important consideration for future studies.
% The use of machine learning can likely be used to find a new characterization of 3D PLI signals to better identify the underlying fiber structure.
% In \ac{dMRI}, nerve fiber models and their simulations and the use of deep learning have already shown that the underlying fiber structure can be identified from the original signals \cite{ginsburgerDis2019}.
% \ac{dMRI} is of course based on other physical models, but the use of deep learning can exploit effects on signals that are not easily analytically visible.

\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
% 
In this thesis two algorithm inside the software package \ac{fastPLI} were presented.
The first algorithm is capable of designing non colliding nerve fiber models in a 3d volume.
These models can then be used inside the second algorithm, which simulated the polarized light interaction with the modelled nerve fibers inside a virtual \ac{3D-PLI} setup.
Each algorithm was implemented as a independent \python{} module capable of utalizing multicore systems.
% 
\paragraph{Nerve fiber modelling software}
The algorithm to desining non colliding nerve fiber models takes as input a list of 4d points for each nerve fiber, where the first three values indicate the $x,y,z$ coordinate in space and the forth value the radii of the nerve fiber at this point.
A nerve fiber is represented with this configuration as a cylindrical tube, capable of changin its radiius along the path.
Each fiber segments containing two adjecent points is checked if a collision occours with another fiber segment.
If so, both fiber segments are pushed slighty abort from each other.
This happends for all fiber segments in the volume as long as any collision is detected.
The length of a fiber segment as well as the bending radius of a nerve fiber is controlled by parameters.
By decrising the mean fiber sebment length the calculation can be significantly enhanced. 
By controlling the fiber bending radius the models are more stiff or \dummy{}.
\par
Multiple functions axists for users to fast generate commenly used nerve fiber  .. such as curves or fiber crossings.
% 
\par
% 
To speed up the process an octree is used to divide the volume intu subvolumes.
This octree can be parallel build and treversed on the \ac{CPU}.
A visualization is available to render the volume allowing a user to interact with the algorithm after each calculation step.
\par
% 
An additional project called \ac{MEDUSA} was desinged in cooperation with \ac{CEA} Neurospin allowing to desing non colliding nerve fiber modles with cells like astrocytes or olegodendrocytes which connect to myelin sorounding axons.
% 
% 
% 
\paragraph{Simulation software}
% 
The simulation software for \ac{3D-PLI} takes a configuration of nerve fibers as input and simulate the light matter interaction inside a \ac{3D-PLI} setup.
The simulation follows the M\"{u}ller-Stokes calculus.
The simulation is split into two conesequitiv parts.
The first parts generateds a discretised 3d tissue.
This tissue is used by the second part, which calculates the light matter iteranction from the stored tissue properties inside the volume by stepping multiple light vectors through the tissue.
The intensity is stored inside an 2d array which can be modelled as a \ac{CCD} array with resolution and noise.
The simulation is capable of simulating a tilted light beam wich allows to measure multiple views from the same sub volume the light is traversing.
Additionally the analysis algorithms are integrated in the software package allowing to calculate the nerve fiber orientation with the inclination analysis tool \ac{ROFL}.
\par
% 
The simulation is caplable of using multiple cores as well as multiple node system, which communicate via \ac{MPI}.
This allows to simulate large volume of nerve fibers which due to the necesarry discretised volume takes up a large .. of memory.
% 
% 
% 
\paragraph{Software package \acs{fastPLI}}
All algorithms are written as modules in \python{} inside the software package \ac{fastPLI}.
The Software package is published as open source software package allowing users to share, ask and further develop the software for a high exchangeability. 
The software was tested by ultiple users and published inside the revied \ac{JOSS}.

\paragraph{Nerve fiber modelling results}
% 
The nerve fiber modelling algorithm controlls the necesarry fiber movement to solve the collisions by the fiber segment length and the fiber bending radius.
Both parameters were characterized against the resulting orientations and computational speed.
To reduce the dimensionality of the possible configurations a set of parameters to describe the model was designed.
This set consit out of 2 relativ angles between the two fiber populations, an inclination angle of the entire model and a population fraction parameter.
This set allows to investigate nerve fiber models up to two nerve fiber populations with any crossing angle in 3d without describing every fiber by itself.
\par
% 
Using this parameters first the characteristics of the modelling parameters was charakterized.
A set of values could be identified which is suitable to generate non colliding nerve fiber models without distoring the initial configuration too much.
Additionally this parameter values are suitable to reduce the runtime in a reasanable amount without loosing any configuration charachteristics or impliing a bias on the resulting models.
To reduce the runtime even further it could be identified that about 1 order of magnitude the processing time can be reduced by not solving the models completly.
The influance of a non collision free model however has to be investigated in an aditionall study.
\par
% 
With the found model software parameters a library of up to two nerve fiber models described by the four model parameters was generated fo the later \ac{3D-PLI} simulation.
The orientation distribution was analysed to be able to use as a comparison for the simulation orientation analysis.
% 
% 
% 
\paragraph{\acs{3D-PLI} simulation results}
Analog to the nerve fiber modelling software first the simulation software parameters were charackerized and measured.
The optical resolution of the used micrsoscope was reproduced with former results as well as the optical noise of the system.
From in \ac{3D-PLI} measured tissue samples the tissues properties were derived so that the simulation with means of its limitations can reproduce the results.
The most important characteristica of the simulations accuracy and speed, the \Voxelsize{} was characterized by using the upper prepaired models.
A lower limit could be identified which has to be used for a given nerve fiber radius.
\par
% 
Using the found software parameters and the prepaird nerve fiber models simulations were performed with a orientation analysis.
The models were spit into four groups, a single, a flat crossing, an inclined crossing and freely crossing nerve fiber populations.
This allowed to concentraid on specific behavier.
\par
% 
In the case of a single nerve fiber population only the inclination of the models was a variable.
With the simulation results it coud be shown, that in the case of a single fiber population the orientation can be correctly identified with an increased uncertanty for very stepp fibers.
Given multiple image pixel statistically the mean value can be correctly measured.
For very steep nerve fibers the relative effective tissue thickness becomes unstable in the inclination analysis.
This behavier can be used to take as an hint how uncertain the results are.
\par
% 
The flat crossing nerve fiber population results for the inclination analysis in a single value, which seems to follows the circular mean value of the individual orientations.
With this behavier mostly the dominant present nerve fiber population is visible, with a slighly systematic error prown to the orientation to the second nerve fiber direction.
With the here choosen nerve fiber radiius distribution and image resolution the involed nerve fiber population orientation could not be resolved.
\par
% 
The inclined crossing nerve fiber population has similar characteristics to the flat crossing case.
The inclination seems also to follor the circular mean value of each population, however due to the fact that inclined nerv fibers result in a smaller change of the polarization of the light, the resulting orientation is distorted to the less inclined fiber population.
Here also no individual orientation of one of the nerve fiber population can be identified from the inclination analysis.
\par
% 
The last studied models were a freely ... nerve fiber populations, so any configuration describable by the four model parameters were possible.
From a \ac{ODF} comparison metric model angles could be identified where the incination analysis of the \ac{3D-PLI} signal is tendet to an error prown and were it is very reliable.
The individual parameters were discussed as well and the underliing behavier could be identified leading to the error prown orientations.
\par
% 
A speedup analysis of the simulation showed that the simulation software with the capabilities of the \ac{MPI} is very parallizable and can utalize a multi node system which makes it possible to simulate large sections without the loss of computation time.
However the tissue generation process is sighly less performend.
However since multiple \ac{3D-PLI} tilted light beam simulation are run on the same discterized tissue this is not an issue.
\par
% 
Many possible further optimizations of the algorithm could be identified.
The overall ... is to increase the computation by utalizing parallel architecuters like an \ac{GPU}.
Already existing algorithms suitable for this kind of calculations, the nerve fiber modelling as well as the \ac{3D-PLI} simulations, could be identified.
