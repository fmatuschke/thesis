Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system.
The creation of a map of the nerve fiber tracts occupies a special position.
In the past, these were only studied postmortem. 
In modern times, diffusion MRI was added and is frequently used clinically.
However, it suffers from a resolution problem that cannot be readily increased in vivo.
Post-mortem studies currently achieve resolutions of a few hundred micrometers for an entire human brain.
Smaller fiber bundles or even individual fibers are lost at this resolution.
Other imaging techniques, such as clearing, make it possible to track individual nerve fibers even in small volumes (a few centimeters).
However, for larger volumes such as the entire human brain, the procedure is very difficult.
A special position is occupied by \ac{3D-PLI}, which allows the measurement of orientation on brain slices by the polarization change of light on myelinated nerve fiber tracts.

In \ac{3D-PLI} currently has challenges are
\begin{itemize}
   \item what is the underlying nerve fiber structure.
   \item what are the possible fiber orientations in crossing or stepp inclined nerve fiber regions
   \item distribution of orientations
\end{itemize}
where simulations could and can provide an answer.

The dissertation provides a novel open-source software package \ac{fastPLI} whose main purpose is to provide a method for densely non-colliding 3D nerve fiber models and to simulate such models in a linear optics using the M\"{u}ller-Stokes calulus of the \ac{3D-PLI} experiment.
Another focus is the use of supercomputing architectures with efficiently developed algorithms to enable simulations of larger models and volumes.
The usefulness will be investigated and limitations will be demonstrated.

One of the biggest unsolved questions in science today is how the brain, especially the human brain, works.
An important role is played by the connectivity of nerve cells among each other.
They may be connected by nerve fibers over a relatively short distance to neighboring cells or to neurons in another part of the brain.
By understanding the conectom of the brain, and the signal processing, \ie{} the cells involed, one can study the origin of the capacity of such struktures.
This are already usend in machine learning techniques like deep learning where different types of neural networks are capapable of solving difficult problems which are necesarrarly nearly impossible to solve by a classic algorithm.
The understanding of the nueral network of brains can help the understanding of designing such networks, \eg{} efficiently solving tasks like image recognition, and vice versa.
% 
Invivo, \ie{} in the living brain, the only technique currenty possible is via \ac{dMRI}.
These have relativly to the structural involed ... \ie{} nerve fiber bundles of several micro meter, a rather small resolution.
These lead to misleading results due to the applied models (see ,meyer hein).
Therefore a higher resolution is necesarry, which also can be applied to learn from and inprove the measuring techniques invivo.
