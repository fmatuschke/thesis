First and foremost, I must thank my supervisors, Prof. Markus Axer.
Without your support and dedicated participation every step of the way throughout the process, this thesis would never have come to fruition. 
You have given me wonderful support over all these years.
I could always count on them and they not only helped me with this thesis or further work at the institute, but also always stood by me when I had personal problems.

Further, I would like to thank my examiners, Prof. Gunnar Schr√∂der and Prof. Katrin Amunts.
I always knew that you both had an open ear for me and I always enjoyed the discussions.

Additionally I want to thanks Prof. Katrin Amunts as a Institut leader of the INM-1 and head of the Human Brain Project (SGA1-2).
I am glad given the oportunity working in our Institue and the Human Brain Project.

My special(hoechster) thanks is to my Famaliy, my parent and my brother.
Without any of them I would have not given the knowlege or orportunaty to study or even succeeding writing this thesis.
As a family we had to make very hard decisions the last few years.
I am very thankful for each and everyone of you.

I want to thank all my colleges at the FZJ.
From the beginning I was felt very welcome and I very much still enjoy working with every one of you.
I would like to thank in particular my co-worker Miriam Menzel.
Without her scientific discussions I would not have managed to come as far as I did.
I am sad you are leaving our working goup but am very certain that you succeed now on your own.
You can always count on me as I could count on you.
My additional special thanks goes to Andrea Brandstaedter.
You are a true friend.
Over the last few years you were always there when I needed sombody to talk to.

I would also like to thank my friends.
I enjoy all the board game hours and hiking together with you guys.
It's always a pleasure to be with you guys and a nice distraction from my work if I needed some relaxation.
