First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Markus Axer.
Without his support and dedicated involvement every step of the way throughout the process, this thesis would never have come to fruition. 
He has given me wonderful support throughout all these years.
I could always count on him no matter what the issues were.

Furthermore, I would like to thank my reviewer, Prof. Dr. Gunnar Schr{\"o}der and Prof. Dr. Katrin Amunts.
I have always enjoyed our insightful discussions and am glad to have been guided through this work by you. 

I would also like to thank Prof. Katrin Amunts in her role as Institute Director of INM-1 and HBP Scientific Director.
I am glad that you gave me the opportunity to participate in both the institute and the HBP.

My special thanks go to my parents and my brother.
I would like to thank my father in particular for instilling in both me and my brother a curiosity about nature and thus science.
My parents have always supported my brother in everything and we could always rely on them.
I would like to thank my brother for always helping me from a very young age.
Without him, I probably would never have dared to tackle a science degree.
We as a family have had to make very difficult decisions in the last few years.
I am very grateful for each and every one of you.

I would like to thank all my colleagues at FZJ.
I felt very welcome from the beginning, and I still enjoy working with each and every one of you.
My particular thanks go to my dear colleague Miriam Menzel.
Without her scientific discussions, I would not have come as far as I have.
Unfortunately, she is leaving our working group, but she can continue to count on me, as I have always been able to count on her.
My further thanks go to Andrea Brandstetter.
She is a true friend and always there when I needed someone to talk to.

Last but not least, I want to thank all of my friends.
I appreciate the various board game sessions and the hikes together.
Being with you guys is always a delight and a welcome diversion from my work when I need to unwind.
