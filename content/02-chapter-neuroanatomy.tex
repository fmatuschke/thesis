\section{Introduction}
%
Neuroanatomy is the study of the structure of the brain.
Its describing regions and the structure of the nervous system in humans and animals.
Techniques such as \ac{dMRI}, fluorescence microscopy, microscopy on stained tissue, autoradiography (to name a few), have been able to study more and more structures from different perspectives in the brain with different resolutions, modalities and contrasts on different species.
% 
\par
%
This chapter gives a general overview of the structure of the brain with its most important regions as well as the nerve fiber architecture.
More in-depth information can be found, for example, in the following literatures \dummy{}.

% The human brain is one of the most complex organs with a great diversity of cells, connections, topography and resulting functionalities.

%
\section{Brain Architecture}
%
The mammal brain consists of three main parts: the brainstem, the cerebellum and the cerebrum (see \cref{fig:humanBrain}).
% 
The brainstem is the connection between the different brain areas and the spinal cord located at the bottom of the brain.
It can be further subdivided into the midbrain, the pons and the medulla obiongata.
The cerebellum is located at the lower rear of the brain. Its most important function is motor control.
It is highly folded \todo{species?} and therefore has a particularly large surface area.
The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain.
As the cerebellum its surface is folded as well \todo{species?}.
The cerebrum is split into a left and right hemisphere.
In addition, the cerebrum can be divided into four parts:
the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes (see \cref{fig:brainLobes}).
The frontal lobe is responsible for voluntary movements of specific body parts as well as the human personality.
The parietal lobe's main functionalities are the processsing of the sensory informations.
The primary function of the occipital lobe is signal processing of the visual system.
The temporal lobe contains auditory functions and language perception in addition to visual memories.
Beneath the brain surface there are also other structures such as the basal gangila or the thalamus.

%
The cerebellum and cerebrum contain a \ac{GM} stucture at the brain surface.
This structure is filled with neurons.
These cells have the task of processing the information of all signals coming from inside and outside of the brain.
These cells are arranged in cortical layers that have different thicknesses, cell types, and densities specific to a brain area.
These cells have a relatively high density and are not only locally interconnected with each other, but connect also with different brain areas (see \cref{fig:nerveFiber,fig:cortLayers}).
Therefore, the folding of the brain is particularly important to increase this layer and therefore the number of cells.
In the human brain there are several billions nerve cells.
There are many types of cells, \eg{} granule or pyramidal cells.
Some cell types can amplify or inhibit a nerve signal.
This highly interconnected structure and arrangement of the various cells is the source of its high number of different functionalities and, in the case of the human species, the origin of the relative high intelligence and consciousness.
Therefore, it is a common goal of mankind to understand the human brain in order to improve the understand.
This may lead to, among other things, a better understanding of the brain's functioning, the emergence of intelligence and consciousness, and an improved understanding of pathophysiological processes that may lead to improved medical treatment of brain deseases.

\end{figure}
%
Nerve cells are connected by nerve fibers.
A typical nerve cell (see \cref{fig:nerveCell}) \todo{if there is such a thing} has a cell body, called a soma, that processes incoming information.
The information arrives via dendrites, which are star-shaped branches that connect to an incoming axon.
The axon is the cell's only information output.
It travels through the brain often associated with nerve fiber bundles to its destination, where it connects with the axon terminal to another brain cells.
After the axons are formed in the brain \dummy{}, no new axons are formed anymore.
Only the strength of the signals and the local structures change.
Among other things, connections that are not needed can be removed in the development.
\par
%
The axon is surrounded by a myelin layers, a lipid layer structure composed of nearby olegodendrides (see \cref{fig:human-brain}).
This substance electrically insulates the axon.
This improves the speed of propagation of the electrical action potential along the axon and also its signal strength.
Its diameter ranges from about $\SI{0.5}{\micro\meter}$ to several $\si{\micro\meter}$ (see \cref{tag:axonDiameter}).
There are many different types of axons.
Some contain a very thick myelin layer, while others have none.
The high density of axons and myelin makes the brain, where the axons are located, look white.
This is where this structure of the brain gets its name \ac{WM} from.
The outer cell body layer is called \ac{GM}.
This color difference is clearly visible in a Nissle stain, in which neurons absorb light (see \cref{fig:coronalStained}).
\par
%
Because this \ac{WM} has such a high density of fibers, up to billions in the corpus calosum, which connects the left and right brain hemisphere, it is almost impossible, even under the microscope, to examine individual fiber tracts through the brain without additional aids.

One approach is myelin staining (see \cref{fig:brainMyelinStain}).
Here, nerve fibers that are myelinated absorb more light than their surroundings, resulting in high contrast.
Thus, even individual nerve fibers can be followed in section.
However, individual nerve fibers are already lost in smaller nerve fiber bundles.
Especially in dense white matter, information about the individual nerves can no longer be obtained.
It also has the disadvantage that no 3d orientation information can be easily determined.
\cref{fig:brainMyelinStain} shows a section using this technique in the human thalamus.
It shows different ways of organizing the nerve fibers.
Both nerve fiber bundles (orange) and network structures within the \ac{GM} are visible.
The latter are present to connect the nerve cells within the \ac{GM}, while the nerve fiber bundles allow the axons to reach their target area.

Another technique is \ac{TPFM}.
\cref{fig:brainTPFM} shows a measurement after \ac{3D-PLI} using the \ac{MAGIC} protocol.
This allows fluorescence measurements of myelin.
The fluorescence arises after the \ac{3D-PLI} sections are \cite{Costantini2021} washed with \ac{PBS}.
The figure shows the 3d structure of \todo{species, region}.
\ac{WM} is present in the lower left part of the volume.
The boundary between \ac{WM} and \ac{GM} is in the upper left to lower right figure.
In the upper right corner, \ac{GM} is present with both single nerve fibers and nerve fiber bundles.

\end{figure}
% 
Another technique is electron microscopy (see \cref{fig:elecMic}).
It shows the tissue with a very high resolution, because the electrons have a much smaller wavelength.
The problem with this technique with tissue is that the measurement must take place in a vaccum, which causes the tissue to dry out.
This causes deformations.
Nevertheless, \cref{fig:elecMic} shows in high detail the layered structure that occurs in the white matter with nerve fibers of different myelin thickness.
\par
%
For different species with smaller brains, such as rodents, imaging techniques like \textit{clearing} [\dummy{}] have a high potential and could already be used to image a \todo{whole?} brain with axons.
However, this has not yet been achieved for a more complex and larger brain.
\ac{PLI}, which uses the birefringence property of myelin, is a promising technique developed as early as 1900 that allows the orientation of axons to be mapped in a brain section [\dummy{}].
This technique, like most microscopic techniques that use sections, has the disadvantage that the brain must be sectioned and then measured.
The cutting distorts the tissue and it must later be aligned in a nontrivial way to restore a complete brain dataset.
This process is also known as image registration.
There are alternative methods such as (OCT? \cite{Aumann2019}), which first measures the brain slice, then cuts away the top layer, and then measures the next slice. It uses the reflection of light rather than the light transmitted through the tissue.
However, no whole large brain like the human brain has been measured in its entirety up to this point.
Since \ac{3D-PLI} uses the already known sectioning techniques that have been developed for several decades, it can use this knowledge to its advantage.

From Miriam thesis:
Brain removed from skull within \SI{24}{\hour} and immersed in a buffered solution of $\SI{4}{\percent}$ formaldehyde
$\SI{20}{\percent}$ glycerin solution for several days after \dummy{}.
$\SI{2}{\percent}$ Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and $\SI{4}{\percent}$ formaldehyde.
\par
% 
For the cutting process, the tissue, \ie{} the brain, has to be frozen and imbedded into a solid material.
One commen material is parafine, however this is not possible for \ac{3D-PLI} \todo{why?}.
For \ac{3D-PLI} it very is important, that the tissue does not build up crystal structures, \eg{} from sugar molecules, because these are also birefringence.
Therefore the tissue is first \dummy{} into a \dummy{} liquid \dummy{}
After a time of a few months the tissue will then be frozen into a $\SI{-80}{\degree}$.
Then the frozen tissue can be fixated with a liquid glue on a cutting plate.
The glue is \dummy{}
It is also be used to build up a surrounding fixating material to stabilize the brain in the cutting process.
Additionally markers are fixed which help in the later registration process, which will align the tissue sections in a 3d volume again \cite{Schober2016,Ali2018,Schmitz2018}.
\par
%
The cutting is done in a microtome (see \cref{fig:brain_sectioning}).
In there the temperature can be held at about $\SI{-70}{\degree}$ and allows no heating of the tissue.
The brain is moved against a vibrating very sharp knife.
This allows for the thin sectioning of about $\SI{60}{\micro\meter}$.
After the cutting, the tissue is put onto a glass specimen.
Since the tissue is such thin and filigran, it is not always possible to avoid cracks for example.
This also will be as best as possible corrected in the registration process.
The tissue will be \dummy{} with a glycerin \dummy{} and finally siled with another glass.
To prevent the formation of waves in the tissue, the glass is weighted.
The tissue sections are then stored into a refrigerator at $\SI{-70}{\degree\celsius}$.
The tissue can then finally be measured in the \ac{3D-PLI} microscopes (see \cref{sec:expSetup} for further techniqule informations).
